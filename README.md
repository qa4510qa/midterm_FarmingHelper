# midterm_FarmingHelper
This is the midterm project of WebProg2019. The work is completed together with another [React-Native version](https://github.com/qa4510qa/CCproject), which is used to attend the Climate Change Competition2019. 

##Overview
FarmingHelper is a cross-platform app for agriculture.
Users can get the optimized answer of when and what to grow simply by entering some information, the available dates, location, considering crops, considering climate factors, crop prices, ...etc.
After entering the data and clicking "Enter", the answer, together with the alternative price of each considering crop, will come up.
FarmingHelper also provides future climate data, which is generated by ourself using the method from SDLab and the data from Central Weather Bureau, and crop data for users to refer to when cropping.
The application supports MacOS, Windows, and IOS now.
* Note:The work is under developing, so there are still some errors in back-end.

## Framework used
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
* [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - The framework used to build native mobile app in IOS 
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) - The run-time JavaScript environment for developing back-end services.
* [Express](https://expressjs.com) - A node package for handling HTTP request with a series of middlewares.
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) - The framework used to build cross-platfrom apps

##How to build
For MacOS and Windows
1. Please find the server machine and follow [this](https://github.com/qa4510qa/midterm_FarmingHelperServer) README to deploy the server.
2. Turn back to your local computer.
3. Make sure you have NPM() and Node() installed.
4. `cd midterm_FarmingHelper`
5. `npm i`
6. In src/const/AppConfig.const.js, set SERVER_IP to `<your server's IP or domain>`.
7. `npm start` to run in debugging mode.
8. `npm run make` to generate executable APP for your platform.

For IOS(developing in Mac)
1. Please find the server machine and follow [this](https://github.com/qa4510qa/midterm_FarmingHelperServer) README to deploy the server.
2. Turn back to your local computer.
3. Make sure you have NPM(^6.4.1) and Node(^10.15.3) installed.
4. Please follow the [React-Native Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) to make a environment for developing React-Native App.
5. `cd CCproject`
6. In src/const/AppConfig.const.js, set SERVER_IP to `<your server's IP or domain>`.
7. `npm start` to run in debugging mode.
8. `npm run make` to generate executable APP for your platform.
* Note:When you run `react-native run ios`, an Xcode simulator will pop up and simulate your app on an iphone.

##How to use
1. Please enter your server IP first. You can enter "localhost" for debugging mode, or use `ifconfig` in terminal to find your server IP for released APP.
2. Page "關於我們":This is the introduction page. We introduce how to use the APP here.
3. Page "試算":This is the main page. You can calculate the optimal answer of cropping here.
4. Page "未來氣候":We provide the climate data here.
5. Page "作物資料":We provide the crop data here.
